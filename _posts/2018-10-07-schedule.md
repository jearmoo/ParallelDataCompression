| Date | Goal |
|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11/4 to 11/10     | Read papers and scour the web for compression algorithms that are parallelizable and techniques with which to parallelize them.    |
| 11/11 to 11/17    | Write code for at least one of the algorithms. Have a working sequential version and a parallel version that is close to finished. |
| 11/18 to 11/24    | Have all the code for at least one of the compression algorithms. Analyze a few metrics. Starting working on another compression algorithm |
| Checkpoint (11/19)| Have a working sequential and parallel vesrion of at least one compression algorithm. |
| 11/25 to 12/1     | Complete at least two sequential and parallel implementations of compression algorithms. |
| 12/2 to 12/8      | Collect all the data necessary for the final report and finish a draft of the final report. |
| 12/9 to 12/15     | Finalize the final report. |
| Final (12/15)     | Present! |
