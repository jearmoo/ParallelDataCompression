| Date | Goal |
|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11/4 to 11/10     | Read papers and scour the web for techniques with which to parallelize the algorithms.    |
| 11/11 to 11/17    | Finish sequential implementations of the Huffman Coding and LZ77 algorithms. Start planning how to parallelize each algorithm on the CPU and GPU. |
| 11/18 to 11/24    | Complete the parallelized versions of Huffman Coding and LZ77 on the CPU using OpenMP. |
| Checkpoint (11/19)| Have completed sequential implementations as well as defined plans of how to parallelize the algorithms on the CPU and GPU.  |
| 11/25 to 12/1     | Complete the parallelized versions of Huffman Coding and LZ77 on the GPU using CUDA. |
| 12/2 to 12/8      | Collect all the data necessary for the final report and finish a draft of the final report. |
| 12/9 to 12/15     | Finalize the final report. |
| Final (12/15)     | Present! |
