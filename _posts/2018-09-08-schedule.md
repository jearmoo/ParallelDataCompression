| Date | Goal |
|:-----------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11/4 to 11/10     | Read papers and scour the web for techniques with which to parallelize the algorithms.    |
| 11/11 to 11/17    | Write most of the sequential implementation of the Huffman Coding algorithm. Start planning how to parallelize each algorithm on the CPU and/or GPU. |
| 11/18 to 11/24    | Complete the parallelized compression and decompression for Huffman Coding. |
| 11/25 to 12/1     | Complete the sequenital and parallel compression code for LZ77. |
| 12/2 to 12/8      | Collect all the data necessary for the final report and finish a draft of the final report. |
| 12/9 to 12/15     | Finalize the final report. |
| Final (12/15)     | Present! |
